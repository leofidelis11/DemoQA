## âœ… Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (14.x or higher)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)  

---

## âš¡ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leofidelis11/DemoQA.git
cd DemoQA
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all dependencies, including Mocha, Chai, Supertest, Cypress, and Mochawesome.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Running API Tests & Generating a Report

To execute your API test suite using Mocha with Supertest and Chai:

```bash
npm run test:api
```

This produces a html report in the `mochawesome-report/` directory.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Running UI (Cypress) Tests & Viewing the Report

#### Run Cypress in headless mode:
To run your Cypress tests and generate test reports:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

Cypress will run headlessly, and Mochawesome will generate a report under `cypress/reports/html`.

#### Run Cypress in headed mode:
Open Cypress app and see tests running in Cypress runner

```bash
npx cypress open
```

---

## ðŸ”„ CI Integration via GitHub Actions

This project includes a CI pipeline configured in `.github/workflows/`, which automatically:
 
- Compile and build project
- Installs dependencies 
- Runs both API and UI tests  

When  changes are pushed or merges, GitHub Actions will trigger the testsâ€”keeping the project continuously validated.
